		<h3>Description</h3>
		
		<p>Lad Na, or <em>Lard Na</em> (how I originally knew it as), was a staple dinner of my college years. My favorite (the only) Thai restaurant near campus made a mean and spicy Lad Na, a Lao-Chinese noodle dish in a gravy-like broth, often topped with chicken, broccoli, and other vegetables.
