		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Sichuan-style Dry (Fried) Green Beans is probably my favorite Chinese dish.
		It's simple to make and checks off everything you want from a Sichuan dish -- dry, slightly numbing, and a decent balance of meat and vegetables.</p>

		<p>This version of the recipe will include pork and Sichuan peppercorn.</p>
